php-pdo
php-pecl-zip
php-mysqlnd
php-mbstring

## Folders permissions

* After you gave permission to write to cache folder. You should see the following window. If you see strange error instead of install make sure that
    * Your browser is pointing to index.php/site_admin/install/install URL
    * You gave recursive write permission to cache folder.

Try to change owner to apache user or the user under which you are running http server.

```shell script
chown apache:apache -R cache/
chown apache:apache -R var/
chown apache:apache settings/
chmod -R 755 cache/
```

After that you should see something like his

​![](/img/install/install-step-1.png)

Now just give permission to write to required folders/files

```shell script
chmod 755 settings/
chmod -R 755 var/storage
chmod -R 755 var/userphoto
chmod -R 755 var/storageform
chmod -R 755 var/storageadmintheme
chmod -R 755 var/botphoto
chmod -R 755 var/bottrphoto
chmod -R 755 var/storageinvitation
chmod -R 755 var/storagedocshare
chmod -R 755 var/storagetheme
chmod -R 755 var/tmpfiles
```

After that all items should be green.

## Database settings

On next screen you should see similar window. Database has to be precreated.

​![](/img/install/database-settings.png)

## Application initial settings

These settings you can fill up according to your needs.

​![](/img/install/initial-app-settings.png)

## Install completed

​![](/img/install/install-completed.png)

## Logging to application

After clicking `Login here` you should be presented with login window.

​![](/img/install/login-window.png)

Install url is always `index.php/site_admin/user/login`

## Dashboard page

This is the main application window.  

​![](/img/install/dashboard-installed.png)

## Generating embed code

Now click on Settings icon ​![](/img/install/settings.png) on top menu. You should see this window.  

​![](/img/install/settings-page.png)

Navigate to

> Embed code -> Widget embed code (new)

You should see window like this

​![](/img/install/html-code.png)

To have proactive enabled check `Check for operator invitation messages`

Embed code should be similar to this. If you copy this code change `install.livehelperchat.com/index.php` to your install path.

```js
<script>var LHC_API = LHC_API||{};
LHC_API.args = {mode:'widget',lhc_base_url:'//install.livehelperchat.com/index.php/',wheight:450,wwidth:350,pheight:520,pwidth:500,leaveamessage:true,proactive:true};
(function() {
var po = document.createElement('script'); po.type = 'text/javascript'; po.async = true;
var date = new Date();po.src = '//install.livehelperchat.com/design/defaulttheme/js/widgetv2/index.js?'+(""+date.getFullYear() + date.getMonth() + date.getDate());
var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s);
})();
</script>
```

For more information and trouble shooting see [integration article](integrating.md).

## Proactive invitation setup

Navigate to

> System configuration -> Live help configuration -> Pro active chat invitations

Here is demo configuration which we have on demo.livehelperchat.com. Some things it does:

* Message to user is send after he spends 20 seconds on page or have more than 2 pageviews.
* We show random profile from online operators
* Also we have to delayed messages there. Delayed messages can be also configured in autor responder sections.
* Also we have there long auto delayed message 40 seconds. If during that period no one accepts a chat message is shown that all operators are busy.

You can see proactive invitation setup on our demo installation.

​![](/img/install/proactive-invitation.png)

And here is instant auto response message.  
​![](/img/install/autoresponder.png)

Here goes automatic auto response message.

## Chat does not start?

If you are running behind CloudFare or any other proxy. Which influences what IP is seen by Live Helper Chat. Please enable in that case in settings file

> https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/a60a3b485ed08650b9e081ed827998e050717e37/lhc_web/settings/settings.ini.default.php#L18

## My widget does not load?

Try to add this in your `.htaccess` file in root folder `lhc_web`. If this folder does not exists just place `.htaccess` in the same folder where `index.php` file exists. It has to be placed in Live Helper Chat folder not a website.

```apacheconfig
AddType application/wasm .wasm

<Files ~ "\.(gif|jpe?g?|png|bmp|swf|css|js|svg|otf|eot|ttf|woff|woff2|swf|mp3|ogg|wasm|map|wav|pdf|ico|txt)$">
  Header always Set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
  Header always Set Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE"
  Header always Set Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, API-Key, Authorization"
</Files>
```

## Chat was closed by an operator/visitor, but visitor starting chat again opens an old chat?

Most likely you have enabled `Chat configuration -> Misc -> Reopen chat functionality enabled`

[More information](chat/configuration.md#reopen-chat-functionality-enabled)

## Install from command line

It's also possible to install from command line.

Copy `install-cli.php` script to root folder (`lhc_web` if you pulled from github)

```shell script
cp cli/install-cli.php install-cli.php
```

Copy default `example.settings.ini` to `settings.ini`. Don't forget to modify them.
```shell script
cp cli/example.settings.ini cli/settings.ini
```

Install Live Helper Chat
```shell script
php install-cli.php cli/settings.ini
```

## Installation under sub-folder

If you are running wordpress site and have nice URL, you might need to allow access to Live Helper Chat subfolder. `.htacess` could look like.

```apacheconfig
RewriteEngine On
# Previous rules
RewriteRule ^lhc_web/.*$ - [L]
# Afterward rules
```

## How to login?
In order to login point your browser to directory where application is installed. URL address should look like http://<your_domain>/index.php/site_admin/
