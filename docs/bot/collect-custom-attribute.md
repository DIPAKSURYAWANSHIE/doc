## Introduction

Purpose of this response type is to collect custom attributes. See an [example](collecting-information.md).

There is an example how to use this attribute from [extension](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/lhccollectcustombot).

## Attributes

Description of all attributes and their purposes.

### Attribute identifier

This is attribute identifier but it's value we decide where collected value will be stored.

Few examples:

* `lhc.email` - set user provided data as chat e-mail
* `lhc.nick` - set user provided data as visitor username
* `lhc.phone` - set user provided data as visitor phone
* `order_number` - non internal attribute. Can be anything.
* `[file]` - this attributes expects that visitor would upload a file. Preg match rule can look like `(gif|jpg|png)`

### Attribute name

Attribute name is used ony if it's not an internal attribute. It will be visible in chat additional information row.

### Preg match rule.

You can have custom validation preg match rule. Few examples

* **^.{5,}+$** string with minimum 5 characters
* **foo** The string “foo”
* **^foo** “foo” at the start of a string
* **foo$** “foo” at the end of a string
* **^foo$** “foo” when it is alone on a string
* **[abc]** a, b, or c
* **[a-z]** Any lowercase letter
* **[^A-Z]** Any character that is not a uppercase letter
* **(gif|jpg)** Matches either `gif` or `jpg`. This can be used to match file extension.
* **[a-z]+** One or more lowercase letters
* **[0-9.-]** Any number, dot, or minus sign
* **^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,}$** Any word of at least one letter, number or _
* **([wx])([yz])** wy, wz, xy, or xz
* **[^A-Za-z0-9]** Any symbol (not a number or a letter)
* **([A-Z]{3}|[0-9]{4})** Matches three letters or four numbers
* **([A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4})** Matches three letters followed by four numbers

Internally validation looks like this

```php
if (!preg_match('/' . $eventData['content']['preg_match'] . '/',$payload)) {
    // Further Live helper chat logic...
}
```

### Custom event to validate

If you define event we will try first to dispatch event 

```php
$handler = erLhcoreClassChatEventDispatcher::getInstance()->dispatch('chat.genericbot_event_handler', array(
    'render' => $eventData['content']['event'], // event you have put.
    'render_args' => (isset($eventData['content']['event_args']) ? $eventData['content']['event_args'] : array()),
    'chat' => & $chat,
    'event' => & $chatEvent,
    'event_data' => $eventData,
    'payload' => & $payload,
));
```

How listen this even in extension see an [example](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/lhccollectcustombot) on github.

### Cancel button enabled on failed validation

You can show a visitor `Cancel` button with your defined text. If you are using extension you will have to throw exception with this option.

You can add a 'cancel' button when using the Telegram module for users. To achieve this, you need to create two separate triggers:

Create a trigger named 'cancel.' Choose the 'send text' department as the first step. Next, add a 'quick reply' and specify the name for the cancel button, with the type set to 'execute trigger.' Choose the second trigger you've created, let's call it 'Cancel Action,' as the trigger to execute.

Create a trigger called 'Cancel Action.' Within this trigger, select the 'send text' department and enter the text that should appear after cancellation. Add a second department, 'update current chat,' and choose the action 'remove any previous process.'

### Intro message

This message is shown before user enters any required information.

### Execute trigger on validation failure

You can choose to execute custom trigger on validation error. See [sample](bot/collecting-information-two-tries.md) how to allow a visitor to enter information two times before terminating a process.

### Validation error message

If validation fails. This message is send to the visitor.

### Success message

If validation passed this message is send to the visitor.

### Execute trigger on success

This trigger is executed once validation is passed and information is collected.

### Execute trigger on cancelation, overrides message on cancelation

This trigger is executed once visitor cancels information collecting workflow.

### Message on cancelation

If you do not define trigger for cancelation this message is send.

### Soft event

In case you see `Please complete previous process` you can avoid this error by checking `Soft event`.

You can also avoid this error manually executing `Update Current chat` response type and choosing `Remove any previous process`

### File expecting trigger example

Scenario if files uploads are disabled by default and enabled by bot automatically and after a successful upload disabled again.

* Files upload for the visitor is disabled. 
* In files configuration section you have enabled `Allow visitor to choose only one file for the upload`
* Very first trigger in bot response is `Send Text` with content `!files no` this will enable files upload for the visitor without sending any message.
* Next response within trigger is the file collecting workflow itself

Files upload trigger configuration example

![](/img/bot/collect-file.png?v=1)

* On success of file upload we disable files upload by sending `Send Text` with content `!stopfiles we have received your file!`

![](/img/bot/file-received.png?v=1)
