Since 3.29v you can setup Live Helper Chat in a such way so it could support multiple clients at once. Altough the best way to support multiple clients is just use automated hosting extension.

I assume you are running at-least 3.29v default setup.

## Creating departments

First we have to create two departments. `Client A` and `Client B`. We do not change anything there.

## Creating users groups

We create two users groups

> System configuration -> Users -> List of groups

We create group `Client A` and then `Client B`. This is required only if you are planning to have more than one operator per company. If it will be only one operator per company, you can skip this step and just remove permissions to see users from same group.

After that to each group we assign `Operators` role.

## Creating users

We create user `clienta` and choose his group as `Client A`

We assign him `Client A` department.

We do same steps with `clientb` user.

## Adjusting operators role permissions

### Removing permissions

Remove permission to see assigned departments so operator won't see other clients departments.

> 'lhuser', 'see_assigned_departments'

By default operators can see all online visitors we want to remove this permission. We do this by editing `Operators` role and removing.

> 'lhchat', 'sees_all_online_visitors'

By default operator sees all operators from group he belongs to. Now is possible to remove this permission by deleting. After you do that operator will see only himself in operators list and not a members of the group he belongs to.

> 'lhuser', 'see_all_group_users'

If you do not want operator to be able to see logged operators from his department remove this permission.

> 'lhuser', 'userlistonline'

If you do not want to allow an operator to see in general online visitors remove this permission.

> 'lhchat','use_onlineusers'

Remove permission for other modules

```
'lhquestionary', 'manage_questionary'
'lhfaq','manage_faq'
'lhchatbox', 'manage_chatbox'
'lhbrowseoffer', 'manage_bo'
